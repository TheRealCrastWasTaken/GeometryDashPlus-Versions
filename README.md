# Welcome to GD+
**Geometry Dash Plus** is a **free-to-use** and *open-source* product made by [Team K&K ZX](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeamKKZX). This product is used for managing, downloading, or creating addons.
## Features
Geometry Dash Plus has a few tabs. The current tabs available are **Saved Addons** and **About**. It has an auto-update system so that you don't have to keep going on GitHub to download the next version, unless there is an error, of course. :)
### Saved Addons
The **Saved Addons** tab can be used to view, activate, rename, remove your addons. You can also open them in explorer.
### About
It's basically just an about page, lol.
## Latest Version
Currently, the latest version is v2.1.2, and can be found [here](https://github.com/TheRealCrastWasTaken/GeometryDashPlus-Versions/blob/master/GD%2B%20v2.1.2.zip).
This specific update fixes a few bugs. That's literally it.
We should also introduce our new member, [GabRio Blu](https://github.com/GabRioBlu)! He will help with the coding of the following versions. Stay tuned for more!
## Upcoming Version
The upcoming version will be v2.2.1, and will introduce a new tab, Discovery!
The Discovery tab will be a place where you can find new addons to discover and download. Discovery uses a GitHub API.
Stay tuned for the new update! **<3**
